The TAPS-4 is designed to assess three intersecting areas: phonological processing, auditory memory, and listening comprehension. These areas are the foundation to the development of high order language skills, including reading skills. Phonological processing, auditory memory and listening comprehension are different than hearing. Hearing refers to the physical behaviors of the eardrum vibrating against the middle ear which stimulates the inner ear. Phonological processing refers to the process of the brain detecting and processing meaningful nonverbal information in sound. Auditory memory is the process in which the brain is able to encode, maintain, and manipulate information in one’s immediate consciousness.
