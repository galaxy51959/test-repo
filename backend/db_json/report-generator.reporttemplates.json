(NAME) obtained a standard score of (XX) and a percentile of 3(XX)which places her in the Average range for the Pictorial Scale Index. The pictorial scale index measures her ability to use Analogical reasoning. Analogical reasoning\nis any type of thinking that relies upon Analogy. An Analogical argument is an explicit representation of a form of Analogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two systems to support the conclusion that some further similarity exists. Something Analogical compares two different things. For example, an analogical expression might be &quot;My house is so\ncold it&#39;s like a refrigerator in here. &quot;An Analogy is a comparison usually either a metaphor or a simile that helps to explain something or make it clearer. Analogical things use Analogies or refer to them. A comparison like &quot;You are quiet as a mouse&quot; or &quot;My brother was a pig at dinner. Analogical reasoning is important to how a student performs in school because being able to use Analogical reasoning will support academic ability in reading, writing, math, and understanding social situations.

More specifically, it measures how students understand the relationship between certain categories or classes. cognitively. For example, a student comprehending and categorizing a question such as “Things that are cats but are not mammals” or “things that are cats and mammals”. The student will have to categorize the information to come to the appropriate answer which is that “All cats are mammals so there are no cats that are not mammals”. Categorical reasoning affects how a person groups information to be able to apply it to a problem\nand/or situation.

      "promptInstructions": "There are several paragraphs.\n\nFirst Paragraph:\n\nThe Comprehension Knowledge (Verbal Comprehension) Index of the WISC-V included the Similarities and Vocabulary subtests. His overall performance on this index fell below age expectations. On the Similarities subtest, STUDENT was read two words that represented common objects or concepts and was asked to describe how they are similar. On this subtest, STUDENT  performed below age expectations. He often was able to indicate that the two objects/concepts were different, but could not describe ways in which they were similar. On the Vocabulary subtest, STUDENT was asked to define words read aloud by the examiner. His performance on this subtest also fell below age expectations. This composite is highly correlated with language-based and reading comprehension ability.\n\nSecond Paragraph:\n\nThe Fluid Reasoning Index consisted of the Matrix Reasoning and Figure Weights subtests. His overall performance on this index fell on the upper end of age expectations, nearly in the above average range. On the Matrix Reasoning subtest, STUDENT viewed an incomplete matrix or series and selected the response option that completed the matrix or series. On\nthis task, STUDENT performed on the higher end of age expectations. On the Figure Weights subtest, STUDENT viewed a scale with missing weight(s) and, within a specific time limit, selected the response option that kept the scale balanced. On this subtest, STUDENT also performed on the higher end of age expectations. This composite is highly correlated with problem-solving and mathematics ability.\n\nThird Paragraph:\n\nThe Working Memory Index consisted of the Digit Span and Picture Span subtests. The Working Memory Index measures a child’s ability to hold information in his/her mind and then use it within a few seconds, as well as to attend to verbally or visually presented information, process that information in memory, and then to formulate a response. Attention, concentration, and mental control are important skills assessed within this\ncomposite. On this index, STUDENT performed solidly within age expectations. On the Digit Span subtest, STUDENT was asked to listen to a string of digit read aloud by the examiner. He then had to repeat the digits in forward and reverse order. He then had to sequence the digits by mentally organizing them by smallest to largest, and then verbalize his response to the examiner. On this subtest, STUDENT performed within the average range when\ncompared to age expectations. On the Picture Span subtest, STUDENT was shown a group of objects presented in a linear fashion. He was asked to remember the pictures in order. A few seconds later, he was asked to identify the pictures, in order, that the examiner had just exposed. On this subtest, (NAME) performed within age expectations.\n\nForth Paragraph:\n\nThe Non-Motor Visual Spatial Index takes place of the standard Visual Spatial Index in this context due to remote administration. The Non-Motor Visual Spatial Index provides insight into a child’s visual-spatial abilities without the requirement of manipulation of physical, tangible items. Overall on this index, (NAME) performed within the average range for his age. Within this index, (NAME) was shown pictures of blocks that were arranged in a particular fashion and was asked to identify the set of blocks that would fit together to create the target picture of blocks. On this subtest, (NAME) performed within the average range when compared to age norms. On the Visual Puzzles subtest, (NAME) was shown a completed puzzle and was asked to select three individual shapes that would need to be put together/manipulated in order to create the target puzzle. On this subtest, (NAME) also performed within the average range based upon age norms.\n\nFifth Paragraph:\n\n(NAME) was administered an additional subtest, the Coding subtest, in order to measure his processing speed with regard to paper-pencil tasks. He was asked to view a key which exemplified the mark associated with each pictured shape. He was then asked to view a set of empty shapes, and within a certain period of time, (NAME) was asked to draw the mark associated with each shape based upon the key. On this subtest, (NAME) worked at an adequate pace. His performance fell within the average range when compared to age norms.\n\nSixth Paragraph:\n\nThe Naming Speed Index provides an estimate of the (NAME)’s basic naming ability and automaticity. These tasks were developed to enhance the assessment of children with suspected learning challenges and are not designed as measures of intellectual ability. The two ancillary subtests that comprise this Index include the Naming Speed Literacy and Naming Speed Quantity subtests. Current evidence suggests that rapid automatic naming\nmeasures significantly predict reading ability in both younger and older children with reading disabilities. On this index, (NAME)’s performance fell below the average range when compared to age norms.\n\nSeventh Paragraph:\n\nOverall, (NAME)’s Nonverbal General Ability Index score fell within the average range when compared to expectations for his age. However, consideration of his performance on individual indices and subtests suggests a profile of strengths and weaknesses. These cognitive weaknesses are empirically linked to the academic weaknesses (NAME) displayed on formal and informal assessment measures."
